# React Native Navigation Example

This is a simple React Native project that demonstrates the usage of stack, drawer, and tab navigation using the React Navigation library.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/HarshaSenarathna/ReactNative-navigation.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd ReactNative-navigation
3. Install dependencies: npm install

## Usage

The project includes three types of navigation:

### Stack Navigation

Stack navigation is used to navigate between screens. In this project, we have two screens: "Home Screen" and "Second Screen."

### Drawer Navigation

Drawer navigation provides a side menu for navigation. It includes "Home Stack" as one of the menu items.

### Tab Navigation

Tab navigation allows you to switch between different tabs at the bottom of the screen. It includes three tabs: "Tab One," "Tab Two," and "Tab Three."

Each of these navigation types is implemented using React Navigation components.

### Running the App

To run the app in development mode, use the following command:

npm start


This will start the Expo development server. You can then use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and open the app. Alternatively, you can run the app on an Android or iOS simulator.

## Folder Structure

- `screens`: Contains the screen components used in the navigation.
- `App.js`: Entry point for the app where navigation is configured.

## Dependencies

- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/): Used for navigation.
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler): Required for gesture handling.
